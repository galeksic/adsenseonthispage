This is **not** stand-alone plugin, it can be used **only** in addition to your existing solution for showing AdSense ads. It should work with:
* other plugins
* and / or if ad code is pasted in template
* and / or text widget
* both synchronous and asynchronous AdSense code
* both content and link units.

##How it works (when it works)

If you disable ads on page, this plugin will search page source and it will replace all occurances of `adsbygoogle.js` and `show_ads.js` with `empty.js`. For more info, please see plugin source.

##TERMS OF USE:

1. YOU UNDERSTAND THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THIS PLUGIN WILL WORK AS EXPECTED, AND YOU WILL USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK. I (DEVELOPER) WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY RESPOSIBLITY FOR ANY KIND OF DAMAGE.
2. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF YOU HAVE (FOR EXAMPLE) PROHIBITED CONTENT ON SITE (**SITE-WIDE ISSUE**), YOU MUST REMOVE THAT CONTENT, NOT ADS. AND YOU WILL USE THIS PLUGIN TO RESOLVE **PAGE-SPECIFIC ISSUES** WITH QUALITY (FOR EXAMPLE) CONTACT PAGE, ABOUT PAGE, ETC.
3. YOU WILL NOT USE PLUGIN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND OR DISAGREE WITH TERMS.

##Keep in mind

**Don't disable ads if you don't have strong reason: no ads - no earnings.**

###And...

This plugin is not really my "work", it is collection of snippets I found on various sites. And I obviously didn't bother to give it some super cool name, but I hope we can live with it.
